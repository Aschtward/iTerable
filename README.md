# iTerable
iTerable is a simple spring application desing to cover the basics needs of a small comerce like restaurants, pub, etc. Was done as a studying project for spring applications and front-end desing. Can handle tables, products, payments and inventory.
So as i'm a back-end dev i also need to improve my knowledge of front-end, for this one i've used bootstrap but i intend to get better at css in other projects.
